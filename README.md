Python-C-Parser
===============

This is a c lexer and parser written in python

Given a simple c program:
1 - break it into tokens,
2 - parse into statements,
3 - print out the Abstract Syntax Tree.

This project is an excuse for me to learn more about parsers, lexers, compilers and the c language.
